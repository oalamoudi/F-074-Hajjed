## Hajjed ( Hajj Hashed )
A real-time crowd management solution to manage and optimize the crowd of Hajj pilgrimage.

## Mutawif-Backend
Mutawif-Backend is a Java based services project which is integrated in Hajjed mobile application. The application uses the backend services to fetch the latest data and perform operations/decisions based on the data.

The project is a maven project with `Java8` and spring boot framework.



## Inspiration
It was two ideas that started HAJJED adventure: Locating and guiding. The most important need for the pilgrim is how to locate his/her location and guide him/her to the right destination. After many brainstorming sessions that started with a screenboard to workflows, it finally leads to the eventual evolution of the HAJJED to create a platform for the purpose of helping the pilgrim and the campaign guide by using an application and wristband for the purpose of locating and guiding. With teammates: Mohammed Alsolami, Omar Alamoudi, Shoaib Ahmed, and Marwan Ayman , Hajjed started forming and growing with every added idea.

## What it does
guides and locates pilgrims to the right destination by using a wristband and combining app. Hajjed ( Hajj Hashed ), a real-time crowd management solution to manage and optimize the crowd of Hajj pilgrimage.

## How We built it
We build this app by using Javascript, XML, HTML in the platforms Android Studio, MongoDB, XCode. We also implement graphic designs creation utilizing Java/Python. 

## Challenges I ran into
Time management was the main difficulty to complete the task, however, our solution was to let each member be creative in his/her task and submit the complete task to other members on time.  

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Each member is proud of this great experience and we have learned as a team how to work together and implement the useful app for Hajj that solves one of the critic problems which is finding the crowding area and guiding the pilgrim to the right directions on the real-time.  

## What We Learned
We learned the critical and valuable lesson without any catastrophes about crowding system and localization solution. We also learned the lesson on why we make comments in our code to help each other follow the path and complete the tasks. 

## What's next for F-074-Hajjed
We are planning to provide the idea and the project to the responsible for the Hajj and update the need to add on more features such as notifications by voices in multi languages and built-in stations for individual requests based on random locations in Makkah.
